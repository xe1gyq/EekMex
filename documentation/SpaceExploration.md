> A CPU for use in space must first be MIL-STD-883 (usually Class M or S, ground based is B). This means it has met the over 100 tests
that the Department of Defense has developed to insure reliable operation.
These tests include: thermal, mechanical, AC electrical and DC electrical tests as well as sampling
requirements for individual wafer inspections.
