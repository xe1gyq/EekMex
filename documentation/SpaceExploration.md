# Space Exploration

> A CPU for use in space must first be MIL-STD-883 (usually Class M or S, ground based is B). This means it has met the over 100 tests that the Department of Defense has developed to insure reliable operation. These tests include: thermal, mechanical, AC electrical and DC electrical tests as well as sampling requirements for individual wafer inspections.

> Also note that MOST spacecraft use many CPUs. Either for redundancy or to split tasks. Being able to separately control EACH component of a spacecraft is very important.This would be impossible if one CPU controlled them all. With each sub-system powered by its own CPU the sub-systems can be better controlled for power management and fault tolerance. (for example if one CPU dies it only would disable one instrument, not the whole spacecraft)
