Primary elements of a ground segment include:

    Mission (or flight) control (or operations) centers[5]:20 (generally with backup sites), which receive and process telemetry and issue commands, data uploads, and software updates to the spacecraft
    Ground (or earth) stations[2]:142 (generally with backups), which provide radio interfaces to the spacecraft for telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) and payload data transmission[4]:4[6][7]
    User terminals,[2]:142 which may be accessed by flight controllers, support personnel, and stakeholders (including science teams or telecommunication customers such as ISPs and individual users)
    Network components, which provide for communication and data transfer between ground segment elements[2]:142[8]
    Integration and test facilities, where vehicles and their interfaces are assembled and tested prior to launch
    Launch sites, from which vehicles are launched into space (The launch vehicle itself is sometimes said to constitute a "transfer segment", separate from the space and ground segments.[5]:21)
